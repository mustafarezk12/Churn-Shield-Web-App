## 🎮 How to Use

### Making Predictions

1. Navigate to the **Predict** tab
2. Enter customer details:
   - **Age**: Customer's age (0-120)
   - **Gender**: Male or Female
   - **Tenure**: Months with the company (0-100)
   - **Usage Frequency**: Monthly usage count
   - **Support Calls**: Monthly support interactions
   - **Payment Delay**: Days of payment delay
   - **Subscription Type**: Basic, Standard, or Premium
   - **Contract Length**: Monthly, Quarterly, or Annual
   - **Total Spend**: Customer's total expenditure
   - **Last Interaction**: Days since last contact

3. Click **Predict** to get instant results with confidence scores

### Viewing Insights

The **Insights** section provides:
- Customer demographic distributions
- Subscription and contract analysis
- Support call patterns
- Interactive dashboard visualizations

## 📊 Dataset Features

The model uses 12 key features to predict customer churn:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `CustomerID` | Unique customer identifier |
| `Age` | Customer age |
| `Gender` | Customer gender |
| `Tenure` | Months as customer |
| `Usage Frequency` | Monthly usage count |
| `Support Calls` | Monthly support contacts |
| `Payment Delay` | Payment delay in days |
| `Subscription Type` | Service tier |
| `Contract Length` | Contract duration |
| `Total Spend` | Total customer expenditure |
| `Last Interaction` | Days since last contact |
| `Churn` | Target variable (0/1) |

## 🧠 Model Performance

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Features**: 10 input features (excluding CustomerID and Churn)
- **Preprocessing**: Standardization using mean and standard deviation
- **Output**: Binary classification with probability scores

## 🎨 User Interface

The application features:
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Navigation**: Easy-to-use horizontal menu
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded prediction results
- **Professional Styling**: Clean and modern interface
